NAME
    App::assh - A wrapper around autossh.

VERSION
    version 1.1.1

SYNOPSIS
    A wrapper around autossh.

MOTIVATION
    `autossh` is a nifty little ssh-keepalive-connection-holder.

    Passing in the ports for the keepalive can be clumsy though: `assh`
    helps you to avoid that.

USAGE
         assh
         assh HOSTNAME

REQUIREMENTS
    First, you will need a file `~/.ssh/config`. It looks something like
    this:

         Host foo
         HostName bar.example.com
         User baz

    With this, you can already leverage standard `ssh` connections:

         ssh foo

    ... instead of

         ssh baz@bar.example.com

    Next, generate a file `~/.autossh_rc` with the following format:

         foo 12345

    ... with the first entry on the line representing your `Host` in
    `~/.ssh/config` and the second item on the line being the port over
    which to keep the autossh connection alive.

    Now you can permanently connect using:

         assh foo

    ... with the connection kept alive across network switches and computer
    shutdowns.

ATTRIBUTES
    *   hosts: HashRef holding the values HOSTNAME => AUTOSSH_PORT

    *   ports: HashRef holding the values HOSTNAME => "USER => USERNAME,
        HOST => HOSTNAME"

    *   ssh_config_file: The path to the ssh config file. Default:
        `~/.ssh/config`

    *   ports_config_file: The path to the ports config (this is what I have
        chosen): `~/.autossh_rc`
